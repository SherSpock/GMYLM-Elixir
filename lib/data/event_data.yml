    And now, with no further ado..."

  - The bell stopped ringing only a few seconds ago, but I’ve already made my way to the front of the school. I’m hurrying out of school even more than usual because today I get to finish my project in the park. As I run past the other kids, I imagine the fortress on the cliff. It’s a fortress I built of leaves and twigs and other stuff at the park, and it sits on a huge moss-covered rock above the creek. The fortress is over 12 inches tall and has little shacks in the courtyard and even a tower. Anyway it took me two afternoons to build the fortress on the rock, and now that it’s built, I get to install the best part! 

  - The drawbridge!

  - All I need is some kind of string or tiny rope or something and I can attach it to the bridge. If I can find something like that, then the bridge will actually raise and lower! I bet I can find something that will work in my secret stash in the park, and now that the rest of the fortress is finished, today is the day to look!

  - "I leave the hidden room in the fir tree in a hurry and head for the fortress on the rock. When I’m climbing up the rocks to the spot where the fortress is, I hear voices. Some kids are talking about my fortress! 


  When I get up to the top, I see there’s three of them. I recognize them all because they go to Hankin, but I don’t really know them since they are all older than me. Their names are Baxter, Vick, & Theodore. Baxter is the oldest and tallest, since he’s in 5th grade. I think Vicky is Vick’s real name, but she doesn’t like it. I know most people called Theodore “Big T” -- which makes sense because he’s pretty big for a 4th grader. 


  When I come closer, Vick puts her hands on her hips and says, “Who are you?”


  “Is this your little house?” says Baxter."

  - "“Yeah, do you like it?”


  “Yeah it’s pretty cool.”  He says. 


  “Hey!”  says Vick, “I got an idea! Why don’t you give us your lunch money?”  she takes a step forward and holds out a hand. She is standing right next to my fortress"

  - "“I don’t have any lunch money. We already had lunch today.”  I try to sound tough, but I’m kinda nervous"

  - "“Oh yeah?” says Baxter. He looks around for a second, and his eyes rest on the fortress. “Well, it’s either lunch money or stick house...which one will it be kid?”  


Vick smiles at me, still holding out her hand. “Come on kid. I don’t believe you got no money...why don’t ya just give us what’s left of your lunch money?”


Baxter and Theodore bend over to inspect the fortress and I say to her “I promise I don’t have any. Could you pl...”"
