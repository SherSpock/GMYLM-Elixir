- :name: Backyard
  :description: Our backyard is awesome.  Theres a bunch of trees and a tall fence all the way around.  I like to have water gun fights or invent tree-climbing tools out here.\n\nThe door at the south end of the yard leads back inside to the laundry room.  The only other place to go from here is up a tree!
  :south: Laundry Room
  :up: Up in my favorite tree

- :name: Basement
  :description: The basement's not scary, okay?  Some people say it is but I say its only scary if theres a storm and the lights are out and something is not put away where you expect it to be and it looks like a person in the shadows.  Otherwise the basement is neat.  It's full of tools and stuff.\n\nThe only way out is back up the stairs.
  :up: Hallway

- :name: Dining Room
  :description: This place is <i>fancy</i>.  I like the table in here because its big enough that I can make inventions on it, but I have to put down newspaper first, and I have to clear it off before dinner every night.\n\nThe kitchen is just north, so you can bring food in here to eat, and the foyer is just east, so you can bring guests in here without letting them see the rest of the messy house.

- :name: Downstairs Bathroom
  :description: The downstairs bathroom is small, but its okay.  Theres the mirror on the wall, and a toilet in here.  Its not very good for finding trap supplies I think.\n\nThe only door is to the west, and leads back to the hallway.
  :west: Hallway

- :name: Foyer
  :description: The front entryway to my house is kept clean.  Mom & Dad dont let me and %nameOfSister% play in here, and we get yelled at when we put our backpacks down in here.  Sis' backpack is on the floor.\n\nThe front yard is just outside to the south.  The hallway is to the north.  The dining room is just west of here, and across to the east is the living room.

- :name: Front Yard
  :description: It's the front yard.  It's covered in grass with a little pathway around the garden leading up to the front door.  Just seeing my yard makes me feel safe... it means I got all the way home from school in one piece!\n\nThe park is just south of here, and the foyer of my house is to the north.

- :name: Garage
  :description: The garage is pretty cool.  A few years ago, Mom & Dad put all the junk and tools up in cabinets on the walls so the cars could fit in the garage.  Then they got more junk and a lawnmower.  So now just one car fits.\n\nI'm too short to open the front garage doors, but the door to the west leads back inside to the laundry room.
  :west: Laundry Room

- :name: Hallway
  :description: The hallway has wooden floors...not as much fun as the kitchen floors. <br><br>Theres not too much to do here, but from here I can go upstairs to the bedrooms and stuff, or down to the basement!\n\nTo the east is the bathroom, to the west is the kitchen, the southern exit leads back to the foyer and the north goes to the laundry room towards the backyard.

- :name: Hankin Elementary School
  :description: Hankin is my school.  The school is a pretty cool building.  Made of brick and really old with designs in the stone parts.  I like the carvings of gears, and the one of the people dancing.  There are lots of kids out in front of the school right now because the bell just rang.
  :east: Hankin School Playground
  :west: The Park
  :on_ground: [Carvings of People Dancing, Spoiled Milk, Balloon] # none of these belong here except carvings
- :name: Hankin School Playground
  :description: The Hankin school playground is a great place.  I spend a lot of time here, on the jungle gym, hanging upside down on the monkey bars, or studying the mechanics of the see-saw.  I like to read inside the plastic crawl tube sometimes.\n\nThe only way out of the playground is west to the front of the school.
  :west: Hankin Elementary School

- :name: Kids Bathroom
  :description: Its really the upstairs bathroom but since only %nameOfSister% and I use it, we call it the kids bathroom.  It has a bathtub and a toilet, and a sink with a mirror.\n\nThe door to the west leads back to the hallway.
  :west: Upstairs Hallway
  :on_ground: []
- :name: Kitchen
  :description: The kitchen is cool.  It's full of good food.  Sometimes Dad forgets to clean out the fridge for a while, or take out the trash, and then it gets gross.  I like the floor because you can slide on it in your socks!  It's Linoleum.  Theres also the kitchen counter in here, which is pretty tall -- only a little below my head.\n\nThe eastern exit leads to the hall, with stairs, and the south goes into the dining room to eat.

- :name: Laundry Room
  :description: We call this the laundry room, I guess because of the laundry.  It has other more interesting stuff in it too, like the cleaning supplies cabinet and a door to the backyard.\n\nThe eastern exit leads to the garage, the north outside, and the south back into the hallway.

- :name: Living Room
  :description: I don't spend much time in the living room.  I just come in here to watch movies.  Dad likes to read in here and he folds laundry in front of the TV sometimes.  Mom uses the stereo to listen to music in here after work some nights.\n\nThe only way out of here is back west to the foyer.

- :name: Mom & Dad's Bathroom
  :description: I basically never go in here.  It's a big bathroom with two sinks in the counter and a huge mirror.  The bath is really big too.  Besides all that it's just the toilet.  \n\nThe only door in here leads east into their bedroom.
  :east: Mom & Dad's Room

- :name: Mom & Dad's Room
  :description: Im definitely not supposed to be in here, so I should probably leave soon.  Mom & Dads bed is in here, and its really big.  Against the other wall is a wooden wardrobe.  \n\nI can get to their bathroom to the west from in here, or back to the hall to the east.

- :name: My Room
  :description: My room is pretty cool.  You can see the backyard from my window, and I have a big corner desk.  \n\nThe only exit here is south to the hallway.

- :name: My Secret Stash
  :description: My secret stash is an old metal lunchbox I dug up.  I took it to this little room I can get to under some fir trees.  When you come around from the back of this one tree by the rocks, its like a little cave with walls of fir needles, and you disappear under here!  So this is where I buried the lunchbox.  It's like a little sunken treasure chest with the lid sticking out, hidden from view with some branches and pine needles that I lay over it.\n\nThe only way out of the secret room is back east to the park.
  :east: The Park

- :name: My Sister's Bedroom
  :description: Im not really supposed to go in here alone.  Ive been in here before though.  %nameOfSister% has a bunch of Rare Bears stuff on the walls, and some drawings that we made.\n\nTheres a door to the north that leads back to the hall.
  :north: Upstairs Hallway
  :on_ground: [Metal Lunchbox]
- :name: The Park
  :description: The park is on the way home from school.  My house is just a block north of here, which is really cool because it means I can go to the park on my walk home every day.  The park has a creek, benches, tennis courts, and a lot of trees.\n\nTo the west, behind a fir tree is my secret stash, where I keep cool stuff I find.  Hankin Elementary School is just east of here.  The rock that sticks out over the creek here was the perfect spot to build my fortress.

- :name: Upstairs Hallway
  :description: The upstairs hallway is pretty much like the downstairs hallway except that it has carpet like all the rooms upstairs.\n\nThe southern door goes to Sis room, the eastern one is the bathroom, the northern door is for my room, and the western door leads to Mom & Dads room.

- :name: Up in my favorite tree
  :description: Up on this branch I can see the whole yard.  It's my favorite place to study.  In fact, my old reading lamp is attached to the tree here.\n\nThe only way to go from here is down.
